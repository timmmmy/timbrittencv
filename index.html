            <p>For the past three years I have delivered large, complex organisational change and beneficial digital services to the UK public on behalf of the UK government working both within HMRC and closely with the Cabinet-Office. My skills revolve around effecting positive change in fast-moving and uncertain circumstances.</p>
            <p>I remain the most rapid Fast-Stream graduate to ever be promoted into a Senior Civil Service position from HMRC and have been rated in the top 5% for performance every year I have worked in the organisation.</p>

            	I manage two dev-ops teams responsible for building the UK Government’s Digital Tax Platform. This platform enables HMRC to build world class digital services iteratively, quickly and hosts them on a stable, performant platform. This role involves leading two teams to deliver complex and operationally important projects such as tax revenue deadlines and ministerial commitments. The dual nature of the role requires strong delegative, organisational and leadership skills.

                In April 2014 I was tasked with delivering A Digital Annual Tax Summary by October 2014. The Tax Summary was a ministerial commitment announced by George Osborne the Chancellor to the Exchequer in the previous years Budget speech.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this project I made the argument to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury that the existing policy driven designs should be replaced using an agile methodology focusing on iterative design through user-research. I won this argument and as a result the Annual Tax Summary received unprecedented user satisfaction ratings.

            	I worked for the Cabinet Office deputy director in revolutionising HMRC digital by piloting four transactional services from different business areas. I was asked to coordinate across the four teams and ensure that any shared deliverables were achieved efficiently and effectively. I did this with a very small budget and team. There was a significant emphasis on speed of delivery in an environment of sparse resource.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of this was between December 2013 February 2014 I designed and delivered a Digital Support function and business model for under £15K which is still used by HMRC to support over 10M UK Taxpayers.

            I was responsible for the planning, buying and tracking of digital advertising campaigns across a number of clients such as National Geographic and Air New Zealand. Working within the Digital medium the ability to interpret data and change buying methods based on that data was essential. As a buyer I built strong negotiating skills.

                Left Click is a small London based IT company which aimed to provide cheap and easy to use solutions to SMEs across greater London. The company emphasises using open source and innovative solutions. While at Left Click I worked on a number of projects which required a varied skill base from hardware installation to web-design.

                I worked on the roll-out of a Pantone colour matching software and hardware combination called ColorMunki in a Fashion Design House. This exciting experience allowed me to work directly with users in an unfamiliar industry. We initially encountered problems as although the hardware would provided accurate assessment of RGB values the desktop screen would not display a close enough representation of the chosen colour. I worked through this issue with one designer adjusting the configuration of the monitor and software until the user was satisfied with the match. Once satisfied I then rolled this same software and configuration out across all fifty machines in the design section of the company.

                Concomitantly I  worked on a design of the Surf Tours Nicaragua company website. Due to the time zone challenges, requirements often changed sometimes after initial designs had been built. I suggested we substitute email with real-time Skype communication enabling faster and more accurate interrogation of requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                During this post I developed an understanding of web-site design including basic HTM and CSS. I learnt basic fundamental principles of email and web servers and a great about small business and communication with customers.
