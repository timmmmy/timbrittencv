            <p>In April 2014 I was tasked with delivering A Digital Annual Tax Summary by October 2014. The Tax Summary was a ministerial commitment announced by British Chancellor to the Excequor, George Osborne is the previous years Budget speech.</p>
            
            <p>The summary was a personallised breakdown of your tax affairs and a matching view of there this money would be spent by the treasury. The policies purpose was to visiuallise the link between tax and the government spend to encourge a view of national collaboration and encourage compliance. During this project I made the argument to the Financial Secutary to the Treasury that the existing policy driven designs should be replaced using an agile methodology focusing on iterative design through user-research. I won this argument and I believe as a result the new Annual Tax summary had fantastic satisfaction results.

            	In April 2013 I was asked to work for the Cabinet Office deputy director tasked with revolutionising HMRC digital by piloting four transactional services from different business areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was responsible for delivering any shared components required by these four service teams and did so with a very small budget and team. This role was a agile scrum master/project management role with huge empthasis on speed of delivery and efficiency in an environment of sparse resource. At that time digital was an expanding directorate with very little organisational structure but highly aspirational goals which put much emthasis on itiative and drive. 
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of this was between December 2013 Febuary 2014 I designed and delivered a Digital Support function and business model for under £15K which is still used by HMRC to support over 10M UK Tax payers. </p>

            I was responsible for the planning, buying and tracking of digital advertising campaigns across a number of clients such as National Geographic and Air New Zealand. Working within the Digital medium the ability to interpret data and change buying methods based on that data was essential. As a buyer I built strong negotiating skills.

            Left Click is a small London based IT company which aimed to provide cheap and easy to use solutions to SMEs across greater London. The company emphasises using open source and innovative solutions. While at Left Click I worked on a number of projects which required a varied skill base from hardware installation to web-design.

            <p>
            I worked on the roll-out of a Pantone colour matching software and hardware combination called ColorMunki in a Fashion Design House. This exciting experience allowed me to work directly with users in an unfamiliar industry. We initially encountered problems as although the hardware would provided accurate assessment of RGB values the desktop screen would not display a close enough representation of the chosen colour. I worked through this issue with one designer adjusting the configuration of the monitor and software until the user was satisfied with the match. Once satisfied I then rolled this same software and configuration out across all fifty machines in the design section of the company.

            Concomitantly I  worked on a design of the Surf Tours Nicaragua company website. Due to the time zone challenges, requirements often changed sometimes after initial designs had been built. I suggested we substitute email with real-time Skype communication enabling faster and more accurate interrogation of requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
            During this post I developed an understanding of web-site design including basic HTM and CSS. I learnt basic fundamental principles of email and web servers and a great about small business and communication with customers.
