            	I manage two dev-ops teams responsible for building the UK Government’s Digital Tax Platform. This platform enables HMRC to build world class digital services iteratively, quickly and hosts them on a stable, performant platform. This role involves leading two teams to deliver complex and operationally important projects such as tax revenue deadlines and ministerial commitments. The dual nature of the role requires strong delegative, organisational and leadership skills.

                In April 2014 I was tasked with delivering A Digital Annual Tax Summary by October 2014. The Tax Summary was a ministerial commitment announced by George Osborne the Chancellor to the Exchequer in the previous years Budget speech.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this project I made the argument to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury that the existing policy driven designs should be replaced using an agile methodology focusing on iterative design through user-research. I won this argument and as a result the Annual Tax Summary received unprecedented user satisfaction ratings.

            	I worked for the Cabinet Office deputy director in revolutionising HMRC digital by piloting four transactional services from different business areas. I was asked to coordinate across the four teams and ensure that any shared deliverables were achieved efficiently and effectively. I did this with a very small budget and team. There was a significant emphasis on speed of delivery in an environment of sparse resource.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of this was between December 2013 February 2014 I designed and delivered a Digital Support function and business model for under £15K which is still used by HMRC to support over 10M UK Taxpayers.

            <p>My role was to plan then buy digital and broadcast advertising campaigns for a number of international clients. The planning aspect of the role required strong analytical skills to analyse customer behaviour and target demographics through behaviour/geographic location and other indicators. The buying aspect required good negotiation and communication skills to acquisition the best prices for clients as well as the ability to handle large client budgets.</p>
            <p>During my time here I worked on several large projects the most memorable included the 2012 Olympics Delivery Authority's twitter campaign where we used geographic targeting to warn spectators of public transport congestion issues in real-time. This has since used as a case study by Twitter.</p>
